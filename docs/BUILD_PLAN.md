# VentureIQ — Build Plan & Problems

Source of truth for scope is `VentureIQ_report (2).pdf` (the Phase-I dissertation
synopsis). That report describes a *5-layer* production platform: Infrastructure,
Startup Data Pipeline, AI Engine, Investor Pipeline, Marketplace & Compliance. Read
literally, this is roughly a funded startup's 18-month product roadmap. This doc is the
honest translation of that into something a 4-person B.E. team can actually build and
defend, plus the specific problems that will bite and how to handle each.

## Phased build order

The report's layers are the right *logical* architecture; build them in a different
*order* than numbered, so there's always something demoable and each phase produces
data the next phase needs.

**Phase 1 — Startup Data Pipeline MVP (weeks 1–4)**
Stage-aware registration form (React + Zod) → Postgres. OCR on uploaded pitch
decks/cap tables (Tesseract to start, LayoutLM-v3 later once there's a labeled sample
to fine-tune on). No enrichment yet, no scoring yet. Seed the sector taxonomy and
`startup`/`startup_financials` tables from `data/raw/*.csv` so the UI and DB aren't
empty during development.

**Phase 2 — Baseline scoring, no fraud/enrichment yet (weeks 4–7)**
Train a first Growth-Potential model on the YC `status` labels
(`data/raw/yc_companies_all.json` — Active/Inactive/Acquired/Public) plus structured
features from the Indian funding CSVs, mirroring the fused-LLM approach from Maarouf et
al. 2025 that the report cites: structured features + BERT embedding of
`long_description`/pitch text, concatenated, into a classifier. This gives a real,
demoable score before a single line of enrichment code exists, and gives the team a
number to compare against later (72–74% balanced accuracy is the paper's baseline —
don't expect to beat it with 1/100th the data).

**Phase 3 — Agentic enrichment, one source at a time (weeks 7–11)**
Build GitHub enrichment first (free, official API, generous rate limits, no consent
flow needed for public data) → founder credibility score becomes real. Then MCA21
lookup (per-CIN, manual-fee-aware, cached 30 days) → registration verification. Defer
GSTN and LinkedIn — both need a consent/licensing story before they can touch a single
real founder's data (see Problem 2 below); build them behind a feature flag against
mocked responses so the rest of the pipeline (deviation flags, fraud signals) can be
built and tested without waiting on that legal work.

**Phase 4 — Fraud detection (weeks 11–13)**
Isolation Forest + autoencoder over the feature store. Train on the (larger) YC/global
data first since there's no labeled Indian fraud data at all (Problem 3) — treat this
explicitly as anomaly detection against "normal" patterns, not fraud classification,
and say so in the dissertation rather than overclaiming.

**Phase 5 — Investor pipeline (weeks 13–17)**
Structured onboarding → cold-start recommendations immediately. Kafka behavioral
tracking + LightFM collaborative filtering once there's enough synthetic/simulated
investor interaction volume to train on (real usage during a UAT period, or a
simulated-user script if UAT can't generate enough events in time).

**Phase 6 — RAG benchmarking (weeks 17–19)**
Pinecone/Weaviate index over the startup corpus built in Phases 1–2. This is the
easiest layer to over-scope — cap it at "retrieve top-10 similar startups, same
stage+sector, ≤24 months old" exactly as the report specifies, and use it to generate
the SHAP-style rationale text, not as a general chat interface.

**Phase 7 — Marketplace & compliance (weeks 19–22, mostly simulated)**
Listing engine, fair-value estimator, matching — real. Escrow, KYC, RoFR, actual money
movement — **simulate, don't implement**, unless the team secures a partnership with a
licensed payment aggregator/escrow provider. See Problem 1.

Each phase should end with something running end-to-end, even if downstream layers are
stubbed — that's what makes the mid-project review and final demo survivable.

## Problems, ranked by how much they can derail the timeline

### Problem 1 — The marketplace layer is a regulated financial product, not a feature
Escrow, RoFR, and secondary transfer of equity stakes fall under SEBI/RBI-regulated
activity (merchant banking, payment aggregation, possibly AIF-adjacent activity
depending on structure). A student project cannot legally hold client money in escrow
or execute real equity transfers without the underlying licenses. **Mitigation:**
scope this layer as a *simulated* transaction flow for the dissertation (mock escrow
state machine, no real payment rails), and say so explicitly in the report rather than
implying production-readiness — reviewers in fintech-adjacent depts will ask about this
directly, and "we built a compliant simulation and documented what real licensing would
require" is a strong answer, "we integrated a payment gateway" for real equity
transactions is not something to actually attempt.

### Problem 2 — Three of the five "verification" data sources aren't bulk-accessible
Detailed in `data/raw/README.md`. MCA21 is per-company and fee-gated beyond basic
fields, GSTN requires the taxpayer's consent per pull (account-aggregator model, not a
scrape), LinkedIn scraping breaks ToS and is actively litigated. **Mitigation:** design
the agentic enrichment layer's interface (a source adapter with `verify(startup_id) ->
EnrichmentRecord`) so each source is swappable — ship with GitHub (free, real) and
mocked adapters for MCA21/GSTN/LinkedIn that return realistic-looking fixture data, and
be upfront in the dissertation that going live on those three needs either paid API
access (e.g. a licensed KYC/AA data partner) or manual verification in a pilot.

### Problem 3 — There is no labeled Indian startup outcome/fraud dataset
The paper VentureIQ's own scoring design is modeled on (Maarouf et al. 2025) trained on
20,172 Crunchbase companies with known IPO/acquisition/funding outcomes. Nothing close
to that exists publicly for India — the seed CSVs in `data/raw/` have funding *events*,
not outcomes (nobody's labeled "this startup failed" at scale). **Mitigation:**
pretrain/structure the model on the global YC dataset (which does have a `status`
label), fine-tune or at minimum sanity-check on whatever labeled India subset the team
can hand-curate (the 222 India-located YC companies is a start, ~200 rows is thin —
budget time to manually label outcomes for e.g. 300–500 of the Indian funding-CSV
companies using public news/LinkedIn "closed"/"acquired by" signals as ground truth).
Report the accuracy honestly against this small eval set rather than presenting it as
equivalent to the paper's number.

### Problem 4 — Cold-start and small-N break the ML components in predictable ways
- LightFM collaborative filtering needs interaction volume the platform won't have
  until real investors use it — the structured-preference cold start (report §6.1.2)
  is not optional, it's load-bearing for the entire pilot period.
- Isolation Forest/autoencoder fraud detection needs enough "normal" examples per
  sector/stage to know what's normal — with a few hundred startups split across a dozen
  sectors and four stages, some buckets will have single-digit counts. Either pool
  across sectors for the anomaly model (losing some precision) or explicitly flag
  low-confidence scores when the reference cohort is under some minimum size (e.g. 20).
- Node2Vec-style network features (report cites arXiv:2511.23364 on this exact
  limitation) can't represent brand-new startups with no investment history — that
  paper's own limitations section says this; VentureIQ's `network_score` should
  degrade gracefully to 0/null rather than error for first-time listings.

### Problem 5 — Five storage systems (Postgres, S3, Pinecone/Weaviate, Neo4j, Kafka) is a lot for one dissertation team to run reliably
Each is independently reasonable; running all five in sync, with monitoring
(Prometheus/ELK per report §7 Layer 1), is a lot of operational surface for four
people alongside coursework. **Mitigation:** `docker-compose` everything locally from
day one so the whole stack is one command for any team member; in Phase 1–2, consider
substituting a Postgres table + pgvector extension for Pinecone and a simple
`networkx` graph for Neo4j, and only promote to the "real" dedicated systems in Phase
5–6 once the data volume/team bandwidth justifies it. This isn't cutting the
architecture from the report — it's sequencing when each piece becomes load-bearing.

### Problem 6 — Explainability across four *different kinds* of model
SHAP is well-defined for tree ensembles and reasonably tractable for small neural nets
(KernelExplainer/DeepExplainer), but "explain an Isolation Forest anomaly score" and
"explain a growth classifier's probability" are different problems being surfaced as
one uniform "SHAP rationale" in the report (§8.3). **Mitigation:** use
`TreeExplainer`-compatible variants for the tree-based fraud detector, a
gradient/kernel explainer for the neural growth/risk models, and be explicit in the
write-up that "explainability" means a per-model-appropriate top-3-features text
summary, not one shared mechanism — that's a more defensible (and more accurate)
claim than implying a single SHAP pipeline handles all four heterogeneous scores.

### Problem 7 — Evaluating "did this recommendation/score turn out to be right?" takes years
Startup success/failure resolves on a multi-year timescale; a one-semester (or even
one-year) dissertation project cannot show real-world validation of its own
predictions. **Mitigation:** validate against the *historical* labeled data (YC
`status`, hand-labeled Indian subset) using standard train/test splits — that's what
the cited papers do too — and be explicit that live-cohort validation is future work,
not a claim the dissertation can make.

## What to *not* build for the dissertation, even though the report mentions it
- Real payment rails / actual escrow of investor funds (Problem 1)
- Bulk LinkedIn/GSTN integration (Problem 2) — mock these, ship GitHub/MCA21 for real
- A fully general RAG chat interface — the report specifies a narrow benchmarking
  retrieval, not an open Q&A assistant; scope creep here eats weeks for no score benefit
- Training the four AI Engine scores jointly / end-to-end — the report itself (§8.3,
  citing the Maarouf ablation) says independent scoring outperforms early fusion
