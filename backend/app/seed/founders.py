"""Bulk founder seeding for the imported corpus.

The seed CSVs mostly lack founder names, and none of them carry the enrichment
fields (prior exits, domain years, GitHub activity) that founder credibility
scores on. Without this step every seeded startup gets the same "no founder data"
score of 25, which makes that whole dimension dead weight in the composite.

So: create founder rows and populate them with the values the *mock* LinkedIn
and GitHub adapters would have returned, and write matching EnrichmentRecord
rows with `is_mock=True` so the provenance is visible in the UI. This is the
bulk equivalent of running the agentic loop over the corpus --- doing it per
startup through the real async loop would take hours for 9k companies and hit
GitHub's rate limit immediately.

Live registrations go through the real path in enrichment/agent.py.
