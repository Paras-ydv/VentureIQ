"""Repair seeded corpus data in place, without rebuilding the database.

`bootstrap.py` drops and recreates everything, which also throws away live
registrations and accounts. This applies the same two corrections to an
existing database, touching only rows that came from the seed loaders:

1. **Burn rates in proportion to the capital raised.** The India funding
   records carry no headcount, and the loader used to draw a random 3-40
   person team for those companies. A company that raised $2.1bn was then
   modelled as five people burning $25k a month against a billion in cash,
   which the interface reported as 49,839 months of runway.

2. **Anonymous founders for corpus companies.** The loader invented human
   names and `linkedin.com/in/...` links for companies it never collected
   founders for, so a real company's page named people who had nothing to do
   with it. The modelled credibility signals stay; the fabricated identity
   goes.

Idempotent: run it as often as you like. Rescore afterwards, because burn and
runway feed the risk score:
